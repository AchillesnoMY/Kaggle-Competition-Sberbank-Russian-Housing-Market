- In this competition, I used three different models trained on different dataset.
  The first one is the XGboost trained on training dataset with added new features. The second one is
  the LightGBM trianed on training dataset without feature engineering. The last model is to use LightGBM 
  trianed on training dataset with feature engineering and get the combined predicitons for both Investment 
  and OwnerOccupier house prices. The final model is linear combination of these three outputs with suitable weights.
